Run away from zombie cubes.

Require multiple cubes. The nearest cube becomes the player cube, which you can control with a gamepad.
The rest cubes become zombie cubes, which chase the player cube. The rule is simple; just run away from zombie cubes forever.
The player cube gets damanged when it caught by zombie cubes. Game is over when the health of the player cube goes zero.

* A board with toio position ids.
* A game pad.

## Health

* Green         ... Fine.
* Yellow        ... Caution.
* Red           ... Danger.
